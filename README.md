### Acknowledgement
Special thanks to PowerBroker2's [original library](https://github.com/PowerBroker2/SerialTransfer) for Arduino. This fork is just a simple modification which lightly builds off of it.

## About
SerialTransferCpp is an easy to use C++ based library for transferring packetized data fast and reliably via **Serial interfaces**. Communicate between your embedded device and computer easily.

[A mirror library is also available for Python!](https://github.com/PowerBroker2/pySerialTransfer) _This library is compatible with the same Python library the original SerialTransfer uses._

This library:
- Is non blocking
- Uses packet delimiters
- Uses consistent overhead byte stuffing
- Uses CRC-8 (Polynomial 0x9B with lookup table)
- Allows the use of dynamically sized packets (packets can have payload lengths anywhere from 1 to 254 bytes)
- Supports user-specified callback functions
- **can transfer bytes, ints, floats, structs, even large files like JPEGs and CSVs!!**

## Packet Anatomy:
```

|      | |      | |      | |      | |      | |      | | | |      | |______|__Stop byte
|      | |      | |      | |      | |      | |      | | | |______|___________8-bit CRC
|      | |      | |      | |      | |      | |      | |_|____________________Rest of payload
|      | |      | |      | |      | |      | |______|________________________2nd payload byte
|      | |      | |      | |      | |______|_________________________________1st payload byte
|      | |      | |      | |______|__________________________________________# of payload bytes
|      | |      | |______|___________________________________________________COBS Overhead byte
|      | |______|____________________________________________________________Packet ID (0 by default)
|______|_____________________________________________________________________Start byte (constant)
```

## ***How To Use:***

See the [example sketches](https://github.com/PowerBroker2/SerialTransfer/tree/master/examples)

- datum = tx/rx a single object
- data = tx/rx multiple objects

### ***NOTE:***
Currently there is no support for the I2C and SPI version of the library, as the primary focus of this library is for embedded â†’ Python, however pull requests are welcome.
